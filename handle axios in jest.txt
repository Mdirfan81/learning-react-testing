IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ: axios issue with 1.x
The issue
You try to run your tests when a production file imports axios 1.x, and you see this error: 

SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module  


The fix
There are a few options to get around this error.

Option #1: Install axios 0.27: 

npm install axios@^0.27
Option #2: Update the npm test script as described in this GitHub issue comment: 

"test": "react-scripts test --transformIgnorePatterns \"node_modules/(?!axios)/\"",
Option #3: Add this Jest config to your package.json, as described in this GitHub issue comment: 

 "jest": {
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "^axios$": "axios/dist/axios.js"
    }
}
What's going on?
Looks like axios 1.x and create-react-app don't play well together. See this GitHub issue for more details.
